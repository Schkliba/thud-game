# Thud Game 
This repository contains my school project implementing a game of [Thud](https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Thud_(game)) in C# language.
Implementation also contains a very unsophisticated AI opponent you can play against if you have no friends or at least not the type of friends that gets excited for a clunky hotseat match of Thud.
